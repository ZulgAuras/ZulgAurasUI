## Troubleshooting

If the addon doesn't appear in your addons list:
- Verify you extracted the folder correctly. The path should be `.../AddOns/ZulgAurasUI/ZulgAurasUI.toc`
- Check that the addon is enabled in the AddOns menu
- Ensure you're using the correct game version (Classic Era/SoD)

If you encounter errors:
- Type `/reload` to reload your UI
- Try resetting the addon with `/zaui reset`
- Check for updates to ensure compatibility with your game version
